# ReactSVGPlaceholder


This package published on a whim while working on something welse. Full docs will be added soon.
I will be making a general purpose version for non-React projects.

This package can be used to make SVG based rectangle placesholders for React. You can define a single rectangle, or multiple in rows or columns. See the preview below,
