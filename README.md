# ReactSVGPlaceholder

This package published on a whim while working on something welse. Full docs will be added soon.
I will be making a general purpose version for non-React projects.

This package can be used to make SVG based rectangle placesholders for React. You can define a single rectangle, or multiple in rows or columns. See the preview below.

Install and place the samples.jsx file in your project to use right away

### Install
npm install @abduljabbar-aj/react-svg-placeholder

### Import
import PlaceholderRect from '@abduljabbar-aj/react-svg-placeholder'
